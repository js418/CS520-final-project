Abstract :
In this article, the pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient between artificial faults and real faults is
calculated , which confirms the conclusion from the reference paper (Evaluating and improving
fault localization techniques, by Spencer Pearson, Jose Campos, Rene Just etc. Technical report
UW-CSE-16-08-03) that real faults and artificial faults are not identical . Furthermore, cross
validation on the performance of fault-localization (FL) techniques are performed. And the
techniques are assessed through two metrics. Results indicate that the rank for mean EXAM
score is the same as mentioned in the paper, while FLT rank shows some difference.
